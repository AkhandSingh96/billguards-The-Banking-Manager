Statement of scope
In present times, all major economic transactions have started taking place digitally. The major trends of modern digital transactions is
substantiated by use of database management. These databases can be accessed by anyone with specific rights, and perform certain actions
on it. The data update is done almost automatically and is much faster. Users can, in present days can access their accounts directly
without going to a bank, making transfers, transactions and accessing cash directly without standing in long queues as was prevalent 
earlier using ATM machines. On employee-side the data is much more organized, and accessing and performing actions on user accounts is 
easier for them. Due to this the bank has better work efficiency and customer experience improves as well.
